# Battleship

Battleship, the game.

1. Use JS methods instead of using traditional loops when possible for conveniency and better time complexity.
2. Mocking should be used sparingly. Mostly for functions that produce side effects(modifying global state, making network requests, or interacting with the file system, apis and databases, slow and complex operations etc..)
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
4. JS compares arrays by reference(memory location) not by content
5. Commit more often. I'm being too lazy with it
6. I need to read the official docs more often.
7. Generally, for responsive and accessible web applications, it's better to use relative units.
