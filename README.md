# Battleship

Battleship, the game.

1. Use JS methods instead of using traditional loops when possible for conveniency and better time complexity.
2. Mocking should be used sparingly. Mostly for functions that produce side effects(modifying global state, making network requests, or interacting with the file system, apis and databases, slow and complex operations etc..)
3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
4. JS compares arrays by reference(memory location) not by content
5. Commit more often. I'm being too lazy with it
6. I need to read the official docs more often.
7. Generally, for responsive and accessible web applications, it's better to use relative units.
8. I familiarize myself with using css classes and pseudoclasses and manipulating classes using js. Its really useful for manipulating the same elements but in when they are in a different state, by adding css classes etc.
9. Omg, i need to really get better applying the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). My functions are too crowded and are not modularized enough. Too much clutter and makes reusability very difficult. Gotta get better at separating DOM manipulation from JS logic and functionality.
10. Writing readable and maintainable code is crucial. Refactoring is very important.
11. Tbh, I'm not feeling Test first development. Development Driven Test Development(DDT) is more intuitive.
